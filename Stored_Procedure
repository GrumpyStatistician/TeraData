/* 
So apparently Teradata is weirdly different than t-sql, stored procedures use in and out parameteres, commonly used for updating,
inserting, deleting information from tables, etc.
However...you cannot set parameters for conditions in a query. Instead, you must create a Macro
 */

/* example one , this is a teradata stored procedure 
this only inserts values into table and taken from https://forgetcode.com/Teradata/1162-Executing-STORED-PROCEDURE */
CREATE PROCEDURE SP_Employee 
(IN name CHAR(20),
IN id INTEGER,
IN dept_no INTEGER,
OUT dname CHAR(10),
INOUT errstr VARCHAR(30))

DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLSTATE VALUE '23505'
SET errstr = 'Duplicate Row.';
 
INSERT INTO Employee (EmpName, EmpNo, DeptNo )
VALUES (name, id, dept_no);
 
SELECT DeptName
INTO dname FROM Department
WHERE DeptNo = dept;
END;

/* Example two, this is a macro, I can save queries and use the parameters to manipulate conditions in the where, 
note: you have to put a colon infront of the variable name, so that it recognizes it
